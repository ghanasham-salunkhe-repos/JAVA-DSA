# Searching & Traversal 
- searching is very important part in computer science

## Linear Search:
- sequential searching inside a list on by one
- best case is to get value at index 0 and worst case is n-1(last value of list)
- not a great searching algorithm


## Binary Search
- it provide better way to do search in list provided that list is sorted
- uses divide and conquere so acheived o(logn) complexity
- its based on binary search algorithm
